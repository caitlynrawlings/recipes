# Recipes I've Tried

A website to track recipes I've tried, hosted at https://caitlynrawlings.github.io/recipes/. There is information like how much I enjoyed the recipe, the original recipe source, any alterations I made, and more.


## Project Goals

Design a website that was useful to me using Figma for prototyping. 
Gain experience using Tailwind CSS.  
Make up fun names for the smoothies I made.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/caitlynrawlings/recipes.git
```

Go to the project directory and install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```


## Running Tests

To run tests, first run the program on locally on port 3000. Then run the command 

```bash
npx cypress open
```

Select 'E2E Testing' then select your prefered browser. Once the Cypress interface opens, select the desired test files from the displayed list, and click on them to run the tests. Cypress will automatically execute the tests and display the results in real-time as the browser interacts with your application.
