# Recipes I've Tried
This GitHub repo started when I started making smoothies. I wanted a place to track which different combos of ingredients I had tried and which I liked the most. While working on it, I decided to turn it into something that I had been wanting long before I had held my first smoothie: a place where I could track all the recipes I had tried, if I liked them, and what adjustments I had made. And that is how "Recipes I've Tired" was born.  
Other goals behind this project were to gain experience using Tailwind CSS, make-up fun names for the smoothies I made, and design a website that was useful to me using Figma for prototyping ([Figma project link](https://www.figma.com/proto/jziVnhsyDv7WbZippOQgm4/Recipes-I've-Tried?node-id=0-1&t=F4BneALTQXMwstyl-1)).
